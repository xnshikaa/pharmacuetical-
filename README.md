2. Upload a clear image of the tablet
3. The system will automatically analyze the image for defects
4. Review the analysis results

### 2. Report Generation
1. Fill in basic information (tablet name, batch number, agency)
2. Provide contamination details
3. Answer recall-related questions
4. Generate comprehensive report

### 3. Report Management
- View all reports in the History section
- Revise reports based on feedback
- Track image analysis results

## Image Requirements

For best analysis results, ensure your images meet these criteria:

- **Resolution**: Minimum 800x600 pixels
- **Lighting**: Well-lit, clear images
- **Background**: White or neutral background
- **Focus**: Tablet should be clearly visible and centered
- **Coverage**: Include both sides if defects are visible
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, or BMP (max 16MB)

## Model Training

### Training Your Own Model

1. **Prepare Training Data**
   ```
   training_data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cracks/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crack1.jpg
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ crack2.png
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discoloration/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discolored1.jpg
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ discolored2.png
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contamination/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contaminated1.jpg
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deformation/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deformed1.jpg
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coating_defects/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coating_defect1.jpg
   ```

2. **Run Training**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py --data_dir training_data --output results.json --report report.txt
   ```

3. **Review Results**
   - Check accuracy metrics
   - Review false positives/negatives
   - Adjust detection parameters

### Improving Model Performance

- **Add More Training Data**: Include diverse images of each defect type
- **Balance Dataset**: Ensure equal representation of all defect types
- **Quality Images**: Use high-quality, well-lit images
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify thresholds in `image_processor.py`

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Flask Web Application** (`app.py`)
   - Handles user interface and form processing
   - Manages file uploads and sessions
   - Integrates with Ollama for report generation

2. **Image Processing Module** (`image_processor.py`)
   - Defect detection algorithms
   - Image preprocessing
   - Analysis result generation

3. **Training Module** (`train_model.py`)
   - Model evaluation and training
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Training report generation

### Defect Detection Algorithms

- **Crack Detection**: Edge detection with morphological operations
- **Discoloration**: Color variance analysis in HSV space
- **Contamination**: Threshold-based dark region detection
- **Deformation**: Shape analysis using contour properties
- **Coating Defects**: Gradient-based surface irregularity detection

## Supported Regulatory Agencies

- **USFDA** (United States Food and Drug Administration)
- **MHRA** (United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency)
- **EMA** (European Medicines Agency)
- **PMDA** (Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency)
- **TGA** (Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration)
- **Health Canada**
- **SFDA** (Saudi Arabia Saudi Food and Drug Authority)
- **Indian FDA**

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for session management
- `OLLAMA_URL`: Ollama server URL (default: http://localhost:11434)
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Directory for uploaded images (default: uploads/)

### Model Parameters
Adjust detection sensitivity in `image_processor.py`:
- Crack detection threshold
- Discoloration variance threshold
- Contamination size limits
- Deformation circularity threshold
- Coating defect gradient threshold

## Security Considerations

- Change default admin credentials in production
- Use secure secret keys
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate file uploads
- Use HTTPS in production

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Preprocessing**: Resize large images for faster processing
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results for repeated images
- **Database**: Use proper database instead of in-memory storage
- **Load Balancing**: Scale for multiple users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama Connection Error**
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Check if llama3 model is available: `ollama list`

2. **Image Analysis Fails**
   - Verify image format is supported
   - Check image file size (max 16MB)
   - Ensure image is not corrupted

3. **Poor Detection Accuracy**
   - Use higher quality images
   - Ensure proper lighting
   - Train model with more data

### Debug Mode
Run with debug enabled:
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
python app.py
```
